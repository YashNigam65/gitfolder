If It's Running in the Background (No Terminal Visible):

Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc).
Go to the "Processes" tab.
Look for "ollama.exe" or "Ollama" in the list.
Right-click it and select "End Task" to kill the process.
Via Command Line (Advanced):

Run: netstat -ano | findstr 11434 to find the Process ID (PID) using port 11434.
Then: taskkill /PID <PID> /F (replace <PID> with the number from the output).


Test Again:

Run: genAI\Scripts\python.exe query.py
Enter your query.
